Basic Chess Endgames
====================

A simple trainer for the most basics chess endgames.

The application generates a position for the kind of basic endgame you have selected, and you must solve it against the computer.

Using binary of Stockfish 8 engine.

This is a rewrite from my own repository BasicChessEndgamesTrainer, which has been developped on Kotlin, but this time targeting the Scala language.
